//Principles of Object Orientation.

1. The World is a Collection of Object.

2. Every Object is Usefull and nothing is useless in this real World.

3. Every object is an constant interaction with another object. No object is in Isolation.

4. Every Object belong to the type. The type is technically called as class. Class doesn't exist in reality, but it is only the Object exists in real.

5. Every object has two parts

*has part:-it refers to a state or property of an object. It is handled using fields(variable).

*does part:-it refers to a behaviour or activity of an object. It is handled using method (function) .
